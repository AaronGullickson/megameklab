overview:The Naga, a name inspired by its cobra-like torso design, represents a stark deviation from the typical warrior culture of personal glory in Clan warfare. Originating from Clan Wolf technicians' modification of a Woodsman to mount Arrow IV launchers, the Naga soon demonstrated its formidable potential in battlefield artillery roles.
capabilities:The Naga stands as a testament to Clan ingenuity in artillery warfare, strategically diverging from the typical emphasis on direct combat. Its primary role is to provide sustained artillery support while maintaining a degree of mobility uncommon in such heavy platforms. The standard Naga is equipped with a powerful pair of Arrow IV launchers, making it a formidable force in long-range bombardment. With six tons of missile ammunition, it can sustain prolonged fire missions. However, the Naga's focus on long-range firepower comes at a cost to its close-quarters defense, compensated only by a minimal array of three small lasers. This configuration underscores its reliance on supporting units for protection against close-range threats, adhering to Clan warfare tactics that favor specialized roles within a combined-arms strategy.
deployment:SPLIT THESE OUT

Alternate Configuration A: Tailored for engagements requiring a balance of long-range and medium-range capabilities, this variant reduces missile ammunition by one ton to accommodate an enhanced laser arsenal. It features an ER Small Laser and two ER Medium Lasers, providing it with more effective responses to medium-range threats. This configuration is particularly useful in scenarios where the Naga might encounter varied enemy types, necessitating a more versatile armament.

Alternate Configuration B: The B configuration, widely favored among Naga pilots, reduces missile payload to four tons to make room for a more robust laser armament. It includes three ER Medium Lasers and an ER Small Laser, significantly improving its defensive and offensive capabilities at medium ranges. This variant is ideal for situations where the Naga requires greater autonomy in defending itself against more agile opponents while still maintaining substantial artillery firepower.

Alternate Configuration C: Designed for enhanced close-combat defense, this variant carries an SRM-6 missile rack, augmenting its short-range firepower. Additionally, it is equipped with two ER Small Lasers. This configuration is adept at dealing with threats that manage to penetrate the frontline and engage in close-quarters combat, offering a balanced mix of missile and energy weapons for various combat scenarios.

Alternate Configuration D: This variant shifts its focus slightly more towards energy weapons, replacing the SRM-6 of Configuration C with an SRM-4 rack. It also upgrades one of the ER Small Lasers to an ER Medium Laser, providing a more potent response at close to medium ranges. This adjustment makes it particularly effective in skirmishes where a blend of maneuverability and firepower is essential.
history:The Naga's lineage can be traced back to the Woodsman, its parent BattleMech. Its design is closely related to the Gargoyle and Timber Wolf OmniMechs, all derivatives of the Woodsman. The O-Bakemono, a DCMS clone, and the Naga II, a refit version, are also part of its extended family.
<p>Initially, the Naga faced limited deployment after the first production run of the Woodsman proved technically unsuccessful. However, its value was undisputedly proven during the battle for Tukayyid. Clan Wolf's Naga-equipped artillery Stars were instrumental in the fall of Brzo and Skupo, demonstrating their effectiveness against ComStar’s Tenth Army formations. This success led to broader adoption among other Clans, including the Hell’s Horses, Snow Ravens, Star Adders, Cloud Cobras, and to a lesser extent, the Jade Falcons.</p>
